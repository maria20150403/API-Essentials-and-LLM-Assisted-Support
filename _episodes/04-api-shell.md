## Fetching data from the web

With a [URL query](https://joshuadull.github.io/APIs-for-Libraries/03-Creating-url-queries/index.html) in hand, the [Unix shell](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-shell/) provides a powerful commandline driven interface for processing and interacting with large amounts of text data.  As the response from many APIs will be in a text-based format, such as JSON or XML, various shell tools will provide us with the functionality  to acquire data and process the response, allowing for easy use of the large existing set of Unix tools.


## Shell Tools  
Building on the skill from [Unix shell](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-shell/) lesson, we add the following commandline programs for working with APIs

- `curl`   - A command line tool for transferring data from URLs
- `jq`  - A commandline JSON processor
- `xmllint`  - A command line XML parser

In this lesson we will use `curl` command for interacting with our API endpoints and either `jq` or `xmllint` to process the return based on the type response that is given by the endpoint.  In both cases we use the Unix shell pipe `|` to redirect the output of the `curl` command into the next for processing.

## API `Get` Requests  
`$ curl  `

Using the Voyager API
~~~
$ curl https://libapp.library.yale.edu/VoySearch/GetBibItem?isxn=9780415704953
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
{"record":[{
"title":"Animism and the question of life /",
"author":"Praet, Istvan, 1974-",
"pdescription":"xiv, 198 pages ; 24 cm.",
"publisher":"Routledge,",
"pubplace":"New York :",
"pubdate":"2014.",
"isxn":"9780415704953",
"oclcmrn":"ocn853435847",
"bibid":"11736943",
"items":[
{"loccode":"sml","itemenum":"NA","itypename":"Circulating","callno":"GN471 .P73X 2014 (LC)","itemstatus":"Not Charged","barcodestatus":"Active","itemchron":"NA","itemid":"10677986","itemformat":"SPM","itypecode":"circ","itemspinelabel":"NA","itemstat":"NA","locname":"SML, Stacks, LC Classification","barcode":"39002123260565","mfhdid":"11858762","availdate":"NA"}
]
}]}

~~~
{: .output}

The API response can be written to a file using the angled bracket `>` followed by a file name:

~~~
$ curl https://libapp.library.yale.edu/VoySearch/GetBibItem?isxn=9780415704953 > file.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

Alternatively, the output can be piped to another command for futher action:

~~~
$ curl https://libapp.library.yale.edu/VoySearch/GetBibItem?isxn=9780415704953 | wc -l
~~~
{: .bash}

This example uses the `wc`` command with the `-l` option to count the number of lines in the response.   



## JSON filtering with `jq`

The `jq` command transforms JSON content through selection and filtering.  Using the Unix shell "pipe" `|` allows us to take the API response that we recieve from our `curl` command, and process it in varoius ways with `jq`  


 

#### Pretty-print with `jq .`
Be default, the JSON returned in most API calls has the white-space removed, while this is more efficient for transfer and makes no operational difference, it makes the data difficult for humans to read.  The `jq` tool can be used to pretty-print, or format the JSON in a human-readable way, using the `.` command.

$ curl https://libapp.library.yale.edu/VoySearch/GetBibItem?isxn=9780415704953  | jq '.'
~~~
{: .bash}

### Filter by Key
`jq` can be used to select the values of a specified key, or keys.  This allows for specific pieces of data, from the overall JSON object to be filtered and returned.

In this example, we return just the title.
~~~
$ curl https://libapp.library.yale.edu/VoySearch/GetBibItem?isxn=9780415704953  | jq '.record[].title''
~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
"Animism and the question of life /"
~~~
{: .output

Since the Voyager API JSON response begins with the root "record" key, with use the element key `.record` followed by the open and close square brackets`[]` to put all of the child elements in an array, the final selector is the `.title` to select all of the title elements for items in the this JSON response.


We can specific multiple keys in a single filter, In this example, we return the title and author by specificy both keys, seperated by a comma.
~~~
$ curl https://libapp.library.yale.edu/VoySearch/GetBibItem?isxn=9780415704953  | jq '.record[]., .record[].author '

~~~
{: .bash}
~~~
"Animism and the question of life /"
"Praet, Istvan, 1974-"

~~~
{: .output}

## XML Processing

Converting response from Voyager API to text, select element



## 
Pipe to other shell tools, create csv, loop?
